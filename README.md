PlanetHealth is a community dedicated to sustainable and healthy communities and individuals.


## Getting Started

PlanetHealth mobile app is written in Dart/Flutter so you will need to setup a flutter development environment. See flutter.dev for setting up Flutter in your environment.

The analytics part is mostly written in Python. A Jupyter/IPython notebook is provided. Instructions for setting up the environment are inside the [`notebook`](./notebook) directory.

Code for the mobile app is under [`planet_health`](./planet_health).
